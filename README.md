Code for my Master's thesis: "Using route length approximations to solve the Covering Tour Problem".

In my Master's thesis i solved the Covering Tour Problem using 4 different heuristic solution methods:
1. A Cost-allocation method
2. An "Online"/"Offline" regression method
3. A mathematical program with different TSP route length approximations as the objective function
4. A Minimum-distance-Maximum-covering method.

And i also developed an improvement heuristic, which improves an initial solution.
